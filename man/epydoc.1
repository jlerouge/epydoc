.\" ================== DESCRIPTION ====================
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B epydoc
generates API documentation for Python modules and packages, based on
their docstrings.  A lightweight markup language called
.B epytext
can be used to format docstrings, and to add information about
specific fields, such as parameters and instance variables.
Currently, epydoc
.B supports
two output formats: HTML and LaTeX.
.PP
The HTML API documentation produced by 
.B epydoc
consists of a set of HTML files.  Two subdirectories are created for
the public and private documentation.  Within each subdirectory,
every class and module is documented in its own file.  An index file,
a trees file, a help file, and a frames-based table of contents are
also created.
.PP
The LaTeX API documentation produced by
.B epydoc
consists of a main LaTeX file, and a LaTeX file for each module.  If
you use the
.BR \-\-dvi ,
.BR \-\-ps ,
or
.B \-\-pdf
options, then
.B epydoc
will invoke external commands to convert the LaTeX output to the
requested format.  Note that the LaTeX files containing the
documentation for individual modules can be included as chapters or
sections of other LaTeX documents, using the LaTeX
.B \\\\include
command.  If you wish to include individual classes in other LaTeX
documents, then use the
.B \-\-separate\-classes
option to produce a separate LaTeX file for each class.
.PP
.B epydoc
can also be used to check the completeness of the API documentation.
In particular, it will check that every package, module, class,
method, and function has a description; and that every variable and
parameter has a description and a type.
.\" ================== OPTIONS ====================
.SH OPTIONS
Options are divided into five categories: action selection options;
HTML documentation generation options; LaTeX documentation generation
options; documentation checking options; and other options.  All
options must preceed the list of modules.
.PP
.B ACTION SELECTION OPTIONS
.RS 4
.TP
.B \-\-html
Generate HTML output. (default)
.TP
.B \-\-latex
Generate LaTeX output.
.TP
.B \-\-dvi
Generate dvi output.  This option first creates LaTeX output, and then
uses
.B latex
and
.B makeindex
to convert the LaTeX files into a single
.B dvi
file.
.TP
.B \-\-ps
Generate postscript output.  This option first creates LaTeX output,
and then uses
.BR latex ,
.BR makeindex ,
and
.BR dvips
to convert the LaTeX files into a single postscript file.
.TP
.B \-\-ps
Generate Adobe Acrobat
.RB ( pdf )
output.  This option first creates LaTeX output, and then uses
.BR latex ,
.BR makeindex ,
.BR dvips ,
and
.BR ps2pdf
to convert the LaTeX files into a single
.B pdf
file.

.B HTML DOCUMENTATION GENERATION OPTIONS 
.RS 4
.TP
.IR modules ...
The list of the modules that should be documented.  Modules can be
specified using module names (such as
.BR os.path ),
filenames (such as
.BR epydoc/epytext.py ),
or directory names (such as
.BR epydoc/ ).
Directory names specify packages, and are expanded to include
all sub-modules and sub-packages.
.TP
.B \-\-builtins
Add the builtin modules (as defined by sys.builtin_module_names) to
the list of modules to document.
.TP
.BI "\-c " sheet ", \-\-css " sheet
CSS stylesheet for HTML files containing public API documentation.  If
.I sheet
is a file, then the stylesheet is copied from that file; otherwise,
.I sheet
is taken to be the name of a built\-in stylesheet.  For a list of
the built\-in stylesheets, run
.BR "epydoc \-\-help css" .
If a CSS stylesheet is not specified, then the default stylesheet is
used.
.TP
.BI "\-\-docformat " format
Set the default value for
.B __docformat__
to
.IR format .
.B __docformat__
is a module variable that specifies the markup language for the
docstrings in a module.  Its value consists of the name of a markup
language, optionally followed by a language code (such as
.B en
for English).  For a list of the markup languages currently recognized
by epydoc, run
.BR "epydoc \-\-help docformat" .
.TP
.BI "\-\-help\-file " file
A file containing the body of the help page for the HTML output.
Navigation bars will be added at the top and bottom of this help file.
If no file is specified, then a default help file is used.
.TP
.BI "\-n " name ", \-\-name " name
The name of the project whose documentation is being generated.  This
is used in the index page's title, and in the help page.  It is also
used to create the homepage link on the navigation bar, if the
.B \-\-navlink
option is not used.
.TP
.BI "\-\-navlink " html
HTML code for the homepage link on the navigation bar.  If this HTML
code contains any hyperlinks
.RB ( "<a href=...>" ),
then it will be inserted verbatim.  If
it does not contain any hperlinks, and a project url is specified
(with
.BR \-\-url ),
then a hyperlink to the specified URL is added to the link.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-frames
Do not display the frames-based table of contents on the main
API documentation page
.RB ( index.html ).
This option just changes the default view; the user can still access
the frames-based table of contents by clicking on
.B frames
in the navigation bar.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-private
Do not generate any documentation for private objects.  This option
can be useful if you want to discourage users from directly accessing
private objects.  This option is also useful if you want to generate
documentation more quickly, since epydoc will only need to produce
half as many HTML pages.
.TP
.BI "\-o " dir ", \-\-output " dir ", \-\-target " dir
The output directory for HTML files.  By default, HTML files are
written to the
.B html
directory.
.TP
.BI "\-\-private\-css " sheet
CSS stylesheet for HTML files containing private API documentation.
If
.I sheet
is a file, then the stylesheet is copied from that file;
otherwise, 
.I sheet
is taken to be the name of a built\-in stylesheet.  For a list of the
built\-in stylesheets, run 
.BR "epydoc \-\-help css" .
If a CSS stylesheet is not specified, then epydoc
copies the stylesheet for public API documentation (see
.BR \-\-css ).
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Produce quiet output.  If
.B \-q
is used multiple times, it produces successively more quiet output (by
suppressing warning messages).
.TP
.B \-\-show\-imports
Include a list of the classes and functions that each module imports
on the module documentation pages.
.TP
.BI "\-t " page ", \-\-top " page
The top page for the documentation. 
.I page
can be the name of a documented module or a class; the name of a file
containing a documented module; an absolute URL (starting
with "http:"); or one of the special names
.BR trees.html ,
.BR indices.html ", or"
.BR help.html ,
indicating the corresponding API documentation pages.
.TP
.BI "\-u " url ", \-\-url " url
The URL of the project's homepage.  This URL is used by the homepage
link on the navigation bar.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Produce verbose output.  If
.B \-v
is used multiple times, it produces successively more verbose output.

.B \-\-separate\-classes
Describe all classes in a separate section of the documentation,
instead of including them in the documentation for their modules.
This creates a separate LaTeX file for each class, so it can also be
useful if you want to include the documentation for one or two classes
as sections of your own LaTeX document.

.SH HTML FILES
The HTML API documentation produced by 
.B epydoc
consists of the following files:
.RS 4
.TP
.B index.html
The standard entry point for the documentation.  Normally,
.B index.html
is a copy of the frames file
.RB ( frames.html ).
But if the
.B \-\-no\-frames
option is used, then
.B index.html
is a copy of the API documentation home page, which is normally the
documentation page for the top-level package or module (or the trees
page if there is no top-level package or module).
.TP
.IB module \-module.html

.RE
.\" ================== DIAGNOSTICS ====================
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Errors are divided into five categories: import errors; epytext
errors; epytext warnings; field warnings; and inspection errors.
Whenver epydoc encounters an error, it issues a warning message that
describes the error, and attempts to continue generating
documentation.
.PP
Import errors indicate that epydoc was unable to import a module.
Import errors typically prevent epydoc from generating documentation
for the module in question.  Epydoc can generate the following import
errors:
.RS 4
.TP
.BI "Bad module name " module
Epydoc attempted to import
.IR module ,
but
.I module
is not a valid name for a Python module.
.TP
.BI "Could not find a UID for " link-target
Epydoc was unable to find the object referred to by an inline link
construction
.RB ( "L{...}" ).
This is usually caused by a typo in the link.
.TP
.BI "Could not import " module
Epydoc attempted to import
.IR module ,
but it failed.  This typically occurs when
.I module
raises an exception.
.TP
.IB file " does not exist"
Epydoc attempted to import the module contained in
.IR file ,
but
.I file
does not exist.
.RE
.PP
Epytext errors are caused by epytext docstrings that contain invalid
markup.  Whenever an epytext error is detected, the docstring in
question is treated as a plaintext docstring.  Epydoc can generate the
following epytext errors:
.RS 4
.TP
.B Bad link target.
The target specified for an inline link contruction
.RB ( "L{...}" )
is not well-formed.  Link targets must be valid python identifiers.
.TP
.B Bad uri target.
The target specified for an inline uri contruction
.RB ( "U{...}" )
is not well-formed.  This typically occurs if inline markup is nested
inside the URI target.  
.TP
.B Fields must be at the top level.
The list of fields
.RB "(" @param ", etc.)"
is contained by some other
block structure (such as a list or a section).
.TP
.B Fields must be the final elements.
The list of fields
.RB "(" @param ", etc.)"
is not at the end of a docstring.
.TP
.B Headings must occur at top level.
The heading is contianed in some other block structure (such as a
list).
.TP
.B Improper doctest block indentation.
The doctest block dedents past the indentation of its initial prompt
line.
.TP
.B Improper heading indentation.
The heading for a section is not left-aligned with the paragraphs in
the section that contains it.
.TP
.B Improper paragraph indentation.
The paragraphs within a block are not left-aligned.  This error is
often generated when plaintext docstrings are parsed using epytext.
.TP
.B Invalid escape.
An unknown escape sequence was used with the inline escape construction
.RB ( "E{...}" ).
.TP
.B Lists must be indented.
An unindented line immediately following a paragraph starts with a
list bullet.  Epydoc is not sure whether you meant to start a new list
item, or meant for a paragraph to include a word that looks like a
bullet.  If you intended the former, then indent the list.  If you
intended the latter, then change the word-wrapping of the paragraph,
or escape the first character of the word that looks like a bullet.
.TP
.B Unbalanced '{'.
The docstring contains unbalanced braces.  Epytext requires that all
braces must be balanced.  To include a single unbalanced brace, use
the escape sequences E{lb} (left brace) and E{rb} (right brace).
.TP
.B Unbalanced '}'.
The docstring contains unbalanced braces.  Epytext requires that all
braces must be balanced.  To include a single unbalanced brace, use
the escape sequences E{lb} (left brace) and E{rb} (right brace).
.TP
.B Unknown inline markup tag.
An unknown tag was used with the inline markup construction (
.IB x {...}
).
.TP
.B Wrong underline character for heading.
The underline character used for this section heading does not
indicate an appopriate section level.  The "=" character should be
used to underline sections; "-" for subsections; and "~" for
subsubsections.
.RE
.PP
Epytext warnings are caused by epytext docstrings that contain
questionable or suspicious markup.  Epytext warnings do
.B not
prevent the docstring in question from being parsed.  Epydoc can
generate the following epytext warnings:
.RS 4
.TP
.B Possible mal-formatted field item.
Epytext detected a line that looks like a field item, but is not
correctly formatted.  This typically occurs when the trailing colon
(":") is not included in the field tag.
.TP
.B Possible heading typo.
Epytext detected a pair of lines that looks like a heading, but the
number of underline characters does not match the number of characters
in the heading.  The number of characters in these two lines must
match exactly for them to be considered a heading.
.RE
.PP
Field warnings are caused by epytext docstrings containing invalid
fields.  The contents of the invalid field are generally ignored.  
Epydoc can generate the following field warnings:
.RS 4
.TP
.BI "@param for unknown parameter " param .
A @param field was used to specify the type for a parameter that is
not included in the function's signature.  This is typically caused by
a typo in the parameter name.
.TP
.IB tag " did not expect an argument."
The field tag
.I tag
was used with an argument, but it does not take one.
.TP
.IB tag " expected an argument."
The field tag
.I tag
was used without an argument, but it requires one.
.TP
.BI "@type for unknown parameter " param .
A @type field was used to specify the type for a parameter that is not
included in the function's signature.  This is typically
caused by a typo in the parameter name.
.TP
.BI "@type for unknown variable " var .
A @type field was used to specify the type for a variable, but no
other information is known about the variable.  This is typically
caused by a typo in the variable name.
.TP
.BI "Unknown field tag " tag .
A docstring contains a field with the unknown tag
.IR tag .
.TP
.BI "Redefinition of " field .
Multiple field tags define the value of
.I field
in the same docstring, but
.I field
can only take a single value.
.RE
.PP
Inspection errors are generated if epydoc encounters problems while
attempting to inspect the properties of a documented object.  Most of
inspection errors do not prevent epydoc from documenting the object in
question.  Epydoc can generate the following inspection errors:
.RS 4
.TP
.BI "The parameters of " inhmethod " do not match " basemethod .
The parameters of the undocumented method
.I inhmethod 
do not match the parameters of the base class method
.I basemethod
that it overrides.  As a result,
.I inhmethod
does not inherit documentation from
.IR basemethod .
If the difference in parameters is intentional, then you can eliminate
the warning by adding a (possibly empty) docstring to
.IR inhmethod .
.TP
.BI "Docmap cannot add a " type
Epydoc attempted to document an object with an unknown type.  This
error is typically generated by packages and modules that manipulate
the import mechanism, such that importing a module produces some other
type of object.
.TP
.BI "UID conflict detected: " uid
Two different objects were assigned the same unique identifier by
epydoc.  This can cause epydoc to substitute the documentation of one
object with the documentation of another object that is assigned the
same unique identifier.  However, this will usually only cause
problems if the two objects with the same unique identifiers are both
modules or classes, in which case the API documentation page for one
object will overwrite the API documentation page for the other object.
.TP
.IB object " appears in multiple builtin modules"
While attempting to determine which module defines the builtin object
.IR object ,
epydoc encountered multiple candidates, and was unable to decide which
candidate was correct.  In this case, epydoc arbitrarily chooses the
first candidate that it finds.
.TP
.IB object " appears in multiple .py modules"
While attempting to determine which module defines the builtin object
.IR object ,
epydoc encountered multiple candidates, and was unable to decide which
candidate was correct.  In this case, epydoc arbitrarily chooses the
first candidate that it finds.
.TP
.IB object " appears in multiple .so modules"
While attempting to determine which module defines the builtin object
.IR object ,
epydoc encountered multiple candidates, and was unable to decide which
candidate was correct.  In this case, epydoc arbitrarily chooses the
first candidate that it finds.
.TP
.BI "Could not find a module for " object
Epydoc was unable to determine which module defines 
.IR object .
If
.I object
is a function, then this will prevent epydoc from generating any
documentation for
.IR object ,
since it does not know what page to put the documentation on.
Otherwise, this will prevent the documentation for
.I object
from including a link to its containing module.
