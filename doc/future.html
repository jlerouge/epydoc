<h1> Epydoc: Future Directions </h1>

<p> I don't expect epydoc to undergo any major changes in the near
future.  In particular, I am unlikely to add any new block structure
constructs (such as tables) to the epytext markup language; it is
currently quite simple and clean, and I'd like to keep it that way.
However, if there are improvements to the epytext markup language that
you feel would not significantly affect its simplicity, let me know.
And if there are any improvements you'd like made to epydoc tool
itself, feel free to <a
href="mailto:edloper@gradient.cis.upenn.edu">email me</a>. </p>

<p> If and when <a
href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">Docutils</a> becomes the
standard framework for Python API Documentation systems, I will look
into integrating epydoc into Docutils. </p>

<h2> To Do </h2>

<p> These are changes I'd like to make, if and when I get the time.
The order that they're listed in roughly reflects the order that I
would do them, if I got time. </p>

<ul>
  <li> Package and release version 1.0. </li>
  <li> Add special escape sequences, such as "<code>{->}</code>". </li>
  <li> Change the parsing algorithm used by fields to eliminate the
  restriction that the blocks contained by a field have indentation
  greater than the indentation of the field tag; and the
  recommendation that field lists be separated from paragraphs by a
  blank line. </li>
  <li> Add LaTeX or docbook output. </li>
</ul>
